title: Naftiko Capabilities Podcast for January 13th, 2026 - How is AI Impacting the Enterprise?
description: >-
  This is the Naftiko Capabilities podcast for January 13th, 2026, where we share excerpts from our conversations with Sam Newman and Simon Wardley on artificial intelligence's impact on the enterprise. Sam's conversation dovetails with last week's episode about microservices, while Simon helps us break down the relationship between the business of AI and the business of cloud computing. Both conversations demonstrate that much of what we're encountering isn't new—we're simply experiencing old playbooks getting refreshed through large language models and generative AI hype.
