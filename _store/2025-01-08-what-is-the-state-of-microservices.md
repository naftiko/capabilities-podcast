title: Naftiko Capabilities Podcast for January 8th, 2026 - What is the State of Microservices?
description: >-
  Microservices continues to be one of the top signals we see when profiling and talking to enterprise organizations about APIs and integration. To better understand the current landscape, we checked in with two microservices experts, Mike Amundsen and Sam Newman, to explore the state of microservices in an age of AI integration. We asked both Mike and Sam about the state of microservices, then went deeper with Sam to explore the business capabilities side—examining how organizational structure, people, and the overall enterprise journey influence microservices adoption and whether teams succeed with their microservices investments.
