title: Naftiko Capabilities Podcast for 19th, 2026 - JSON Structure
description: >-
  In this episode, I sit down with Clemens Vasters, Principal Architect for Messaging and Real-Time Intelligence Services at Microsoft, to talk about JSON Structure — a new spec designed to take on the territory JSON Schema has dominated for years. Clemens shares the origin story behind JSON Structure, why JSON Schema and Avro both fell short for Microsoft's real-time data pipeline needs, and how he built a cleaner, more focused data definition language that keeps the familiar shape developers already know while cutting out the complexity that breaks tooling.
