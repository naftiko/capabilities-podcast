title: Naftiko Capabilities Podcast for January 15th, 2026 - What is the Hypermedia?
description: >-
  This episode of Naftiko Capabilities explores hypermedia through a business-outcomes lens, grounding long-standing API and integration concepts in the realities of today’s AI-driven moment. We bring together conversations with Mike Amundsen and Kevin Swiber to unpack hypermedia not as an abstract theory, but as the practical art of making meaningful, late-bound connections between systems using rich metadata, shared semantics, and clear affordances for action. Ultimately, the episode connects hypermedia’s roots in REST and HTML to modern AI workflows, arguing that well-modeled resources, behaviors, and transitions remain essential capabilities for building systems that humans and machines can both understand and use effectively.
