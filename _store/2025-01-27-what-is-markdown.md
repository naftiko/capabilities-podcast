title: Naftiko Capabilities Podcast for January 27th, 2026 - What is Markdown?
description: >-
  In this episode of the Naftiko Capabilities podcast, we sit down with Anil Dash—blogger, creator, and former founder of Glitch—to explore the fascinating origin story and enduring relevance of Markdown. Dash offers a firsthand account of how John Gruber's simple plain-text formatting tool emerged from the early blogging era on Movable Type, was beta-tested by the late Aaron Schwartz, and eventually spread through GitHub and Stack Overflow to become what Dash calls "the control plane for AI." The conversation surfaces unexpected wisdom: Markdown's lack of rigid standardization, once a source of frustration for technically-minded developers, may actually be the secret to its success—keeping it accessible, hackable, and resistant to enterprise capture. Dash reflects on how the push for formal specs and big-company validation often makes tools harder to implement and easier to co-opt, while the messy, human-scale origins of standards like Markdown and early RSS allowed them to thrive organically. It's a thoughtful meditation on what really matters when building technology that lasts: not impressive credentials or enterprise adoption, but real people making real things.
