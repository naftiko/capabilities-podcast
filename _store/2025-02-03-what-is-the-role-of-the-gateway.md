title: Naftiko Capabilities Podcast for February 3rd, 2026 - What is the Role of the Gateway?
description: >-
  What happens when the gateway patterns we built for REST don't fit the AI agent world? Christian Posta, CTO at Solo.io, joins me to talk about why MCP and agent-to-agent communication demanded a completely new proxy architecture, how identity and authorization get complicated when non-deterministic agents start calling the shots, and the security risks lurking in runtime MCP server changes. Plus, we dig into Solo.io's open source strategy with Agent Gateway and what enterprises actually need to get MCP into production.
