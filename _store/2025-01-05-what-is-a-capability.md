  This is the Naftiko Capabilities podcast for January 6th, 2026, where we sit down with Mike Amundsen and Christian Posta and ask them, “What is a Capability?. Mike brings a rich understanding of the web, hypermedia, and semantics, while Christian dives into the technical details from the artificial intelligence perspective, MCP, and the gateway view of capabilities. This discussion is helping inform what we are building at Naftiko when it comes to capability-centered integrations and automation, kicking of a new podcast series focused on aligning engineering and business with more capabilities thinking that helps us all get down to business when it comes to enterprise integrations.
